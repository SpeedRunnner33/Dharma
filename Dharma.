A new routine is needed. Routine is the basis.

Change your perception of yourself, instead of 'I am an addict' -> ' I am a free man'. and put feelingüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è into it. Feel it. Always, especially when you go to sleep.
See yourself in the future, as if you already reached 6 months of freedom, and go to sleep with this powerful taste of freedom. always. You're free already. Its easy.

**DAILY** Routine.
