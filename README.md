Brave is needed to work. My presets blocks Edge & Firefox because there are ways to bypass the filter through them.

.>Browser - it blocks brave (it should be your only browser) during night, from 22:00 -> 06:00 every day , because most temptations arise at night. when you want to sleep early. 
But you can play games, watch offline content, read downloaded books.. or even access certain websites though [this app](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) .

To install it, click 'code' -> 'Download ZIP', unzip it, go to the folder and hold SHIFT & press right click on the background -> '```Open PowerShell here```' and run the mentioned command ->``` npm install -g nativefier```
Install the dependencies and that's it, you can install some websites and use them, like www.cineby.app or glorian.org or [more here](https://odysee.com/@Soren:71/%F0%9F%94%B0Megathread_with_Resources%F0%9F%94%B0:1) / more [here](https://fmhy.xyz/videopiracyguide#anime-streaming), the command would be ```nativefier 'web.whatsapp.com'``` ;
Now even if your browser is banned, you can access these websites outside of it.

the block ``Keywords`` blocks most keywords that are used access porn, & reddit & twitter block the main site except some accounts or subreddits, click on any of them and 'whitelist' and add your own.
the ðŸ”’ is meant to block all the internet except certain websites, if need be, you can use it. or you can 'nativefier' them with the app mentioned above.

3. Download my [host file](https://odysee.com/@NewLife:0ae/HOSTS_____:4) , click the 3 dots & download, and put it in the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\ , You can further costumize it as you please.

4. Download this ->  https://cleanbrowsing.org/help/docs/setup-content-filtering-on-windows-with-cleanbrowsing/ & add select 'Free adult filter', then go to settings & add a random password (like aaaajdd923321 cxcxewk#(*#0!@*(#*@!(#!()io321iIODAIDADDA), then forget it. This will only block 99.99% of porn sites so you don't need to undo it.

Download other github projects that you may use (and torrent magnets and browser extensions) , then block github too just to be sure. 

5. Block the Cold turkey blocks for 1-3 months. after you tested a bit and are sure that it works well. - otherwise open an issue & I will try to help.

Go at your router and change the DNS to the clean browsing one, [so](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/CleanBrowsing)

 you can set the time delay to more than 24h, maybe to 72h. Some temptations last more than 1 day. But do this only after you configured it & installed the apps that you need.

 The BlockList keywords. Torrent & magnet are needed to block torrent sites. Knaben is one of them. You can also block reddit since it's an evil site & use it only from PC if need be. [ few subreddits are ok].

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c47e6e1-7489-4705-8e00-e4ad3613df74)
 the WhiteList keywords. The DNS already blocks 99.99% of porn sites so blocking sites with too many keywords is not needed.

You can also use the Focus Mode feature to block your phone for x hours. In that case, add a bunch of whitelisted apps, to listen to some music & be able to read some books & access the basic apps. 
I also recommend NetherSX2, you can play PS2 games on it, just google the optimal settings.
