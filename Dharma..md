"The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. "

A new routine is needed. Routine is the basis. There is no point to block porn and then to want to watch it, because you will. 
The only way to change is to become a non-user, now. Who are you? Choose, say it, feel it. 

Change your perception of yourself, instead of 'I am an addict' -> ' I am a free man'. and put feelingüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è into it. Feel it. Always, especially when you go to sleep.
See yourself in the future, as if you already reached 6 months of freedom, and go to sleep with this powerful taste of freedom. always. You're free already. It's easy. Try it. For the next 3 weeks, go to sleep feeling another 'I Am' - visualise that you already reached freedom and feel it over and over as a loop, make it feel & look like reality. This works because our thoughts and feelings contribute to the reality that we manifest. Combine it with the rest here and you're already there üòä!

"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching.

Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the spirit of the words.

Rely not on theory, but on experience.

Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it.

Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations.

Do not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many.

Do not believe in anything because it is written in your religious books.

Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders.

But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."

-Buddha, Kalama Sutra

"Japa is a marvellous divine soap for the mind. Japa gives a nice refreshing, exhilarating spiritual bath. It wonderfully washes the subtle body or Linga Sarira or astral body. It cleanses it of its various kinds of impurities. Japa purifies the heart. Japa steadies the mind. It destroys the Shad Ripus (enemies of the mind). It destroys births and death. Japa burns the sins. Japa scorches the Samskaras (mental impressions that develop bad karma). Japa annihilates attachment and induces Vairagya (detachment of worldy problems). Japa roots out all desires and makes one fearless. Japa removes delusion and gives supreme peace. Japa develops Prema ( Love, affection) and unites the devotee with the Lord. Japa gives health, wealth, strength and long life. Japa brings God_consciousness. Japa awakens Kundalini and bestows eternal bliss."

"The repetition of the Mantra removes the dirt of the mind
such as lust, anger, greed, etc. Just as the mirror acquires the power of reflection when the dirt covering it is removed, even so the mind from which the impurities have been removed, acquires the capacity to reflect the higher spiritual Truth. Just as soap cleanses the cloth of its impurities, so also, the Mantra is a spiritual soap cleansing the mind. Just as fire cleanses gold of its impurities, so also Mantra cleanses the mind of its impurities. Even a little recitation of a Mantra with Bhava (emotion for God) and concentration on its meaning with one-pointed mind, destroys all impurities of the mind."

-Swami Sivananda.
